<p>
We will then download the Rewrite Module.  This is needed for osTicket to access URLs behind the scenes properly.  (Link to download: <a href="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1tIK9GZBKj1JyUP87eewxgdNqn9pZmVmY&export=download">Download Rewrite Module</a>)

<p>
We will then create a new directory in the C:\ drive called PHP to store all of our PHP files.
